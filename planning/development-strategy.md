All About Trees

- This website offers an informative overview of trees, including an
  introductory section that provides valuable insights into their
  characteristics and unique features.

# setup

The website has been set up with several key components. These include:

. A boilerplate HTML file, which serves as a foundation for the site's code and
ensures consistency across pages.

. The main file, index.html, which serves as the landing page for the site and
provides an overview of the content.

. A pages folder, which contains additional pages linked to from the index.html
file. This allows for a more extensive and informative website with multiple
sections or topics.

. An img folder, which contains relevant images used throughout the site,
including a prominent image of a tree.

. A css folder, which includes the style.css file responsible for styling and
layout of the website. This allows for a consistent and professional appearance
across all pages of the site.

# Site Title

As a user, I can easily read the title of the website, which is adorned on both
sides with a tree emoji. This adds a fun and visually appealing element to the
website while also emphasizing its focus on trees and the environment.

# HTML

The html code is used to create a header with a prominent site title.

# CSS

Css has been used to center the site title.
