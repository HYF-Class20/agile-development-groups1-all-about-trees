# Branching Out

## Overview
This project aims to create a website that provides an online resource dedicated to educating and raising awareness about trees. Our platform is designed to cater to the needs of individuals with a range of interests and abilities. The website will include various resources, such as articles, videos, and diagrams, to educate the public on different types of trees, their importance, and how they can help protect them.
Head Section
Introduction
The Branching Out website is a comprehensive resource designed to provide the public of all ages with an understanding of trees, their types, and their benefits. The website is intended to learn about the importance of trees and how they can help protect them.

## Content
The website includes the following sections:
*	*About Trees*: A section that provides information on trees, such as their anatomy, lifecycle, and ecological significance.
*	*Types of Trees*: A section that covers different types of trees, including their characteristics, habitat, and distribution.
*	*Benefits of Trees*: A section that highlights the various benefits of trees, such as their role in mitigating climate change, improving air quality, and providing habitat for wildlife.

## Interactive Tools
The website also includes interactive tools to engage and reinforce the knowledge. These tools include links to diagrams, articles, and videos.

## Extra Section
In addition to the above, the website includes a section on the public can get involved in protecting trees and their environment. This section provides tips and resources on how to take action and make a difference.

## Footer
The footer of the website includes useful links, such as:
*	*Contact Us*: A link to a contact form where the users can provide feedback or ask questions.
*	*About Us*: A page that provides information about the creators of the website.
*	*Privacy Policy*: A page that outlines the website's privacy policy and how it protects users' information.

## Target Audience
The target audience for this website is individuals with an interest in trees and their role in the ecosystem, including environmentalists who are passionate about tree conservation and education, and arborists with hearing impairments who need accessible resources and tools to provide quality tree care services. The platform is designed to cater to a diverse range of interests and abilities by providing a content designed to be accessible and engaging.


## Technology Used
The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Brainstorming

> - What user needs and business problem does this app cover?
> - Who is the user?
> - What is the business?

## Prioritizing

> How to decide which stories to focus on.

At this stage in planning your team will decide which stories are more aor less
important. You will be writing your ideas into a _backlog_.

## Acceptance Criteria

> How you'll know when a story is finished.

Now that you have an idea what the project will eventually be like, it's time to
get specific. Acceptance criteria are a way to scope and verify your user
stories.

> Given [context] when [a specific action is performed] then [a set of > > > > >
>
> > consequences should occur]

You can write your first-draft acceptance criteria in your backlog, later moving
them under each user story in your `development-strategy.md`, and ultimately
creating a checklist in each issue.

## User Story Dependencies

> How to plan your development schedule.

Some user stories depend on each other, some do not. Figuring out these
relationships will make it possible go from a disorganized backlog to an
organized development strategy.

Understanding these dependencies can also allow you to develop much more
efficiently. You can develope user stories that do not depend on each other in
parallel instead of waiting for one to finish before moving on the next.

Here are some questions you can ask yourself to help understand your project:

- Do I need _A_ in order to be able to build _B_?
- Can the user do B without A being available?

A nice way to visualize these relationships is by creating a graph to visually
represent dependencies:

[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) is a great tool for collaboratively
writing these diagrams.

## Defining Tasks

> How to break the story into coding tasks.

Answering these questions is a way to break down complex user stories and to
determine what code is needed. Following this questions guide will help you fill
in the specifications of each step in your `development-strategy.md`

Handlers are the glue of your user stories. Understanding your answers to these
questions will not only help you decide which tasks to develop, but can be used
to plan the details of the user story's handler:

1. **User Story Objectives**
   1. _... ?_
2. **User Flow ?**
   1. _... ?_
3. **Wireframes ?**
   1. _... ?_

## Project Board

> How to manage your team's project

Convert your development strategy into milestones (user stories), issues, labels
and a project board. When you create the milestones for your user stories, you
can include the _acceptance criteria_ as a checklist in the milestone's
description.

This isn't a permanent thing! You can always adjust the project board and
development strategy as the project evolves; adding issues, removing issues,
adjusting tasks ... whatever is necessary to make the project go smoothly.

## Sprinting and Reviewing

The fun part, writing code and closing issues ;)
