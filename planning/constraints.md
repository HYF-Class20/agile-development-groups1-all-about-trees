# Constraints

This document outlines the various constraints that are associated with our
project. These constraints can be broadly categorized into three categories -
External, Internal (Involuntary), and Internal (Voluntary).

## External

Constraints that come from outside our team and are beyond our control. These
may include:

- Legal regulations or compliance requirements that must be followed
- Project deadlines
- Availability of required third-party services or resources
- Unpredictable events such as natural disasters or unexpected economic changes
- Availability of key stakeholders or decision-makers

## Internal

### Involuntary

Constraints that come from within our team and are beyond our control. These may
include:

- Unexpected personal events or circumstances that may impact a team member's
  availability or productivity
- Health issues or illnesses that may impact a team member's ability to work on
  the project
- Lack of access to required hardware or software tools
- Technical issues or system failures that impact the progress of the project

### Voluntary

Constraints that our team has decided on to help scope the project. These may
include:

- Team members with varying skill levels and experience
- Different working styles and preferences among team members
- Team members with different time zones or availability
- The need for team members to balance project work with other responsibilities
  or commitments.

By identifying and acknowledging these constraints, we can better plan our
project and work within the boundaries that are set.
