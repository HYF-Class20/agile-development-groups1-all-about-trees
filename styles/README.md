# CSS Files Folder

This folder contains all the CSS files for the project.

## What is CSS?

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It's a language used to style web pages,
and it works alongside HTML and JavaScript to make web pages look and feel the
way they do.

## Why are CSS files important?

CSS files are an essential part of web development because they control the
visual appearance of web pages. By using CSS, developers can control everything
from font styles and colors to layout and positioning.

## How to use the CSS files in this folder

To use the CSS files in this folder, you'll need to link to them in your HTML
files. Here's an example of how to link to a CSS file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my web page!</h1>
    <p>This is some text.</p>
  </body>
</html>

In this example, the `href` attribute in the link tag points to the `styles.css`
file located in the `css` folder. This tells the browser to use the styles
defined in that file to render the web page. **Conclusion** By using the CSS
files in this folder, you can create beautiful and responsive web pages that
look great on any device. So go ahead and start experimenting with different
styles, and see what you can create!
